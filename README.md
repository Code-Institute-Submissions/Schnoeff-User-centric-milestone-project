Sophie's Cafe

My project was inspired from my sister who has been starting up a coffee shop for a few months and i decided to create a website for her future coffee shop. I decided that the website should include at least the front page, menu and frequently asked questions. I decided to add the additional reviews page a couple of hours into making the website as i thought that it would just add an extra layer of professionalism and authenticity to the site. When i came to the home page i tried to make it basic enough so that the page didn't look intimidating to approach and easy to navigate but just enough to make it look unique and stand out from the crowd. I used two short paragraphs and two images in opposing positions to make the page look intersting to read with an image to accompany it so that the user can get an acual look at what the text was describing.

For the website i decided to go use sharp and cursive fonts throughout to portray the professional and upmarket style of the cafe. I used semi dark colors throughout the webpage such as brown and grey which i believed to make the webpage keep its professional feel. The website features a collapsable navigation bar which when reaching a resolution under 1024 x 1366 will collaspe in to a neat and tidy drop down menu. I also uncluded the use of the hover feature which helps the further clarify what navigation options they are hovering over. The webpage also features a newsletter sign up feature on the home page where the user can input their email address which when working will allow emails to be sent to the user containing promotional information.Also, on the reviews page underneath the pre-existing reviews there is a form section where the user can also fill in their details and leave a comment. When this feature has the appropriate back end support it would then upload that review to the list of reviews displayed on the page. 

UX

This website is aimed mostly towards people in their mid twenties and above and also anyone who has dogs. This is comes from the website specifying that the coffee shop is perfect for dog owners and a large percentage of young people are not very fond of coffees. I tried to give off the impression that the site was designed for slightly older people with my color scheme and fonts which i believe would only stand out and appeal to those a little older and would seem too grown up for children. 

The aim of the website is for the user to be able to get an insight to what the coffee shop has to offer and also to view what the coffee shop looks like using the few pictures on the screen and the locational information specified in the footer. The aim of the home page is to be eye catching enough to draw in internet users and keep them there long enough so that they get a chance to have a look around and read what it's all about. For the menu page i tried to achieve a sophisticated and succinct page which very clearly highlights what each food or drink item is available with a supporting image for each. The images choices where quite specific because to further intice the user to carry on looking around and potentially visiting the coffee shop i had to pick images that really showed off each item and give the user a feeling like they had no choice but to go and try something.
