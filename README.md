Sophie's Cafe

My project was inspired from my sister who has been starting up a coffee shop for a few months and i decided to create a website for her future coffee shop. I decided that the website should include at least the front page, menu and frequently asked questions. I decided to add the additional reviews page a couple of hours into making the website as i thought that it would just add an extra layer of professionalism and authenticity to the site. When i came to the home page i tried to make it basic enough so that the page didn't look intimidating to approach and easy to navigate but just enough to make it look unique and stand out from the crowd. I used two short paragraphs and two images in opposing positions to make the page look intersting to read with an image to accompany it so that the user can get an acual look at what the text was describing.

For the website i decided to go use sharp and cursive fonts throughout to portray the professional and upmarket style of the cafe. I used semi dark colors throughout the webpage such as brown and grey which i believed to make the webpage keep its professional feel. The website features a collapsable navigation bar which when reaching a resolution under 1024 x 1366 will collaspe in to a neat and tidy drop down menu. I also uncluded the use of the hover feature which helps the further clarify what navigation options they are hovering over. The webpage also features a newsletter sign up feature on the home page where the user can input their email address which when working will allow emails to be sent to the user containing promotional information.Also, on the reviews page underneath the pre-existing reviews there is a form section where the user can also fill in their details and leave a comment. When this feature has the appropriate back end support it would then upload that review to the list of reviews displayed on the page. 

UX

This website is aimed mostly towards people in their mid twenties and above and also anyone who has dogs. This is comes from the website specifying that the coffee shop is perfect for dog owners and a large percentage of young people are not very fond of coffees. I tried to give off the impression that the site was designed for slightly older people with my color scheme and fonts which i believe would only stand out and appeal to those a little older and would seem too grown up for children. 

The aim of the website is for the user to be able to get an insight to what the coffee shop has to offer and also to view what the coffee shop looks like using the few pictures on the screen and the locational information specified in the footer. The aim of the home page is to be eye catching enough to draw in internet users and keep them there long enough so that they get a chance to have a look around and read what it's all about. For the menu page i tried to achieve a sophisticated and succinct page which very clearly highlights what each food or drink item is available with a supporting image for each. The images choices where quite specific because to further intice the user to carry on looking around and potentially visiting the coffee shop i had to pick images that really showed off each item and give the user a feeling like they had no choice but to go and try something. 

I believe that my project is the best way to achieve these points because i have made the website in such a way that the target user is not too narrow meaning that the design and interface should be appealing and accessable to a very wide variety of people. I have also made it very clear in one of the opening paragraphs on the home page that dogs are welcome which should widen the different types of people that would be intersted in visiting the cafe. I also believe that my project is perfect for the filling a gap for what people need this website for. It is very simple and easy to navigate and every aspect of the webpage is very clear and to the point leaving no chance of misinterpretation.  

One example could be that a young couple would like to go out for a coffee one morning but there are either not many interesting coffee shops around or the ones that they have already tried are not up to their standard so they might be trying to look around to try and find something fresh nearby. They would then want to be able to visit the site and have a look at what food and drink is on offer and where the cafe is located. This could all be done with 1 click, all they would need to do is either scroll down on the home page for the locational information and then click on the menu tab at the top of the screen which would lead them straigh to the cafe menu which includes pictures and short description which will allow them to decided on wether they would like to visit or not. They would also be able to check out the latest reviews so that they can get some assurance that it really is a good place to go and get something to eat or drink.

Another scenario could be that an old couple that own a dog are wanting to go out for lunch but they cant leave the dog at home alone. Because the website is simple and easy to navigate they would have no problem being able to click on the website and read the second paragraph on the home page and they would see that they allow all dogs and alos provide treats and water. They would then be able to choose if they would like to go and have their lunch there or not.

Before starting to make my project i drew up a small mock website on a piece of paper outlining what i would like to include on each page and how i would like it to work. This made the development process much easier as i had the design in front of me at all times and all i had to do was make it. I have attached pictures of the drawings as a pdf file in the directory.
